# odin-recipes

In this project, I will utilize my current knowledge of HTML to set up
a recipe website. It'll be like a blog of sorts where I write down 
recipes I've picked up and my associated throughts. This project topic
was originally found on The Odin Project Fudamentals, which allows 
learners to practice and show off their HTML skills. So far I've 
learned the following basics, all of which I hope to make use of 
throughout this project:

* Setting up the HTML boilerplate
* Using elements such as strong, p and em to display text
* Using elements such as ul, ol and li to create lists
* Using elements such as a and img to display images and links
* Efficiently commiting changes through Git
