# odin-recipes

In this project, I will utilize my current knowledge of HTML to set up
a recipe website. It'll be like a blog of sorts where I write down 
recipes I've picked up and my associated throughts. So far I've 
learned the following basics, all of which I hope to make use of 
throughout this project:

*Setting up the HTML boilerplate
*Using elements such as <strong>, <p> and <em> to display text
*Using elements such as <ul>, <ol> and <li> to create lists
*Using elements such as <a> and <img> to display images and links
*Efficiently commiting changes through Git
