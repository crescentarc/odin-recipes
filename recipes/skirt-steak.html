        <p>This tutorial, which I learned through the YouTube cooking series
        <em>Binging with Babish</em>, teaches how to cook thinner cuts of beef. 
        It also provides instructions on marinating the beef with spices like 
        salt and pepper prior to cooking. Cuts like strip steak tend to 
        be on the inexpensive side, so this tutorial is good for your 
        average late night dinner. These cuts of steak don't require 
        an oven, so it's less time and labor consuming to cook.</p>

        <p> Other points to keep in mind are as follows: At the end, 
        there are steps to let the steak rest before cutting. from
        what I've researched, this is to ensure that the steak maintain
        it's juicy flavor. Additionally, the cutting process involves
        cutting perpendicular of <strong>muscle fibers</strong>, which 
        are those visible, vertical lines running across the meat. 
        Cutting perpendicular to those lines ensures that the steak is 
        tender and soft to the bite.</p>

            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Grinded black pepper (ideally freshly ground)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Equipment</h2>

        <ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by seasoning the steaks generously with kosher
                salt and black pepper, but only on one side of the steak.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 (or 2) Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium high

                <li>After the steaks have rested for 10 minutes, they are
                ready to carve.</li>
                <li>Cut each steak into two halves.</li>
                <li>Cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers that run 
                the length of the steak at an angle.</li>
            </ol>
