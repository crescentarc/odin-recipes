        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is a recipe for cooked pasta mixed with basil pesto
        sauce, which I picked up from YouTuber <em>Adam Ragusea</em>. 
        Although the preperation for the sauce may require you to go out 
        of your way for a <strong>mortar and pestle</strong>, once you 
        have one, you'll find that pesto sauce is arguably more convenient 
        to make than tomato pastas. It doesn't require you to use a stovetop 
        to boil and so is rather quick and easy to make.</p>

        <p>I heard once that pesto pasta is the instant ramen of Italy in
        that many university students of that country can quickly, easily
        and cheaply acquire this dish. Since the only stovetop cooking
        that needs to be done is with the pasta, I can imagine that
        being the case. This recipe assumes you're making a single
        portion, but if you want to say, make it for two people, doubling
        the amount for each ingredient works just fine.</p>

        <p>For reference, below is a link to that video from Adam Ragusea

        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients (for a single portion)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 garlic clove (5g), peeled</li>
            <li>1 handful (10g) pine nuts (or any other nut)</li>
            <li>1 handful (10g) grated pecorino or parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 big bunch (25g) fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>pinch of sugar</li>
            <li>good olive oil (I usually use about a glug per serving)</li>
            <li>pasta (1/4 lb, 113g is a generous single portion)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Equipment</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Mortar and Pestle (ideally a set made of stone)</li>
            <li>Sharp knife (i.e. a chef's knife)</li>
            <li>Cheese grater (if you prefer freshly shredded cheese)</li>
            <li>Stovetop pot for cooking the pasta</li>
            <li>Measuing cup (if you want to be precise with ingredients)</li>
            <li>Cutting board</li>
            <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Start boiling pasta in salted water (about a pinch or 2
            of salt works well), following the instructions on the pasta
            box. Keep an eye on this pasta throughout the steps.</li>
            <li>Chop up the basil (helps with mixing later) and shred
            cheese (if needed).</li>
            <li>Use mortar and pestle to grnd garlic, salt and sugar
            until liquified.</li>
            <li>Add in chopped basil and shredded cheese, then grind 
            together.</li>
            <li>Add in olive oil. At this point, it's best to mix with
            the wooden spoon for a more saucy consistency.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is just about ready, drain the water, 
            but leave a little of the water in the pot. It will further
            help with making the pesto more saucy. You can also take even 
            more of that water with a cup before draining for the next step.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the pesto to the pasta in the pot, adding
            more starchy water or olive oil to adjust consistency as
            desired.</li>
        </ol>
