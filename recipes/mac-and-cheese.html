        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is a recipe I picked up from YouTuber <em>Adam Ragusea</em> 
        for creamy mac and cheese with an optional crunchy topping. Instead of
        being confined to the type of cheese or pasta that store-bought
        mac and cheese mixes contain, this recipe allows for more freedom
        in how you cook it. The ingredient measurements below assume that 
        you're making it for one person, but feel free to multiply them if 
        you're making for more people (i.e. 1 cup of semi-firm cheese for 
        two people instead of just 1/2 cup). Though, the one key component 
        to making the creamy sauce that you see in the store bought stuff is 
        <strong>American cheese slices</strong>.</p>

        <p>Basically, American cheese slices contain sodium citrate and
        sodium phosphate which causes the it to smoothly melt and 
        emulsify with the rest of the cheese mix that will be prepared,
        resulting in the desired creamy consistency. However, when buying
        the American cheese from brands like Kraft, it's better to buy a 
        pack where the label mentions it as just <em>"American Cheese"</em> 
        instead of <em>"American Cheese Product"</em>. The latter item
        contains more actual cheese than the former and would result in
        a tastier and more genuine mac and cheese.</p>

        <p>For reference, below is a link to that video from Adam Ragusea</p>

        <h2>Mac and Cheese Ingredients (for one person as a main dish)</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1/3-1/2 cup (80-120 ml) milk (depending on how thick

            <li>1-2 (15-30 g) tablespoons butter (depending on how rich
            you want it)</li>
            <li>1 cup (100 g) any semi firm cheese(s), grated and packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (3 slices, 50 g) processed cheese (American
            cheese, "cheese slice," etc) torn and packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (50 g) any semi firm cheese(s), grated and
            packed (i.e. gouda and cheddar cheese)</li>
            <li>(Optional) Herbs and spices for flavoring</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Breadcrumb topping (for one person as a main dish)</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon (7 g) butter</li>
            <li>1/8 cup (11 g) breadcrumbs (i.e. panko)</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon herbs and/or spices (i.e. herbs de provence)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Measuring cup (if you want to precise with the
            ingredients)</li>
            <li>Stovetop pot for cooking the pasta</li>
            <li>Stovetop pan for cooking the cheese sauce</li>
            <li>Cheese grater (if you prefer freshly shredded cheese)</li>
            <li>Silicone spatula</li>
            <li>Another stovetop pan for cooking the breadcrumb topping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Grate the semi-firm cheese and tear up the American
            cheese.</li>
            <li>Get a pot of salted water coming to a boil for the
            noodles.</li>
            <li>Make the breadcrumb topping by melting the butter in a
            small pan on medium-high heat and mixing in the breadcrumbs,
            stirring constantly until almost brown.</li>
            <li>Add in the herbs/spices to the breadcrumb topping and
            cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Dump the finished topping onto a paper towel lined
            surface to drain and cool.</li>
            <li>Once the pot of water is boiling, prepare the pasta to
            be cooked.
            </li>
            <li>In the other pot, combine the milk, cheeses and butter.
            Stir on medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Not consistently
            stirring causes the sauce to irreversibly curdle and break.</li>
            <li> Once it is totally melted and simmering, consider adding
            more milk if the sauce looks too thick (the sauce will thicken
            as it cools to eating temperature).</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and stir it into the cheese sauce, adding any 
            additional seasonings as desired.</li>
            <li>Transfer finished pasta to a plate and top with breadcrumb
            topping.</li>
        </ol>
